Feature: notify
    In order to provide notifications of activities
    As a developer
    I need to use annotations to give instructions on notifying blog activities

Scenario: Trigger notification that "SiteOwner" created a post
    Given "SiteOwner" creates a new post named "My New Post"
    And the "SiteOwner" publishes the post "My New Post"
    Then a notification is dispatched
    And a reference to "My New Post" is persisted as the "object" of the notification
    And "publish" is persisted as the verb of the notification
    And a reference to "SiteOwner" is persisted as the "actor" of the notification

Scenario: Trigger notification that "SiteOwner" updated a post
    Given "SiteOwner" creates a new post named "My New Post"
    And the "SiteOwner" publishes the post "My New Post"
    And the "SiteOwner" updates the post "My New Post"
    Then a notification is dispatched
    And a reference to "My New Post" is persisted as the "object" of the notification
    And "update" is persisted as the verb of the notification
    And a reference to "SiteOwner" is persisted as the "actor" of the notification

Scenario: Trigger notification that "SiteGuest" commented on a post
    Given "SiteGuest" creates a comment on the post "My New Post"
    Then a notification is dispatched
    And a reference to "SiteGuest comment" is persisted as the "object" of the notification
    And "add" is persisted as the verb of the notification
    And a reference to "SiteGuest" is persisted as the "actor" of the notification

Scenario: Trigger notification that "SiteOwner" deletes a post
    Given "SiteOwner" creates a new post named "My New Post"
    And the "SiteOwner" publishes the post "My New Post"
    And "SiteOwner" deletes the post "My New Post"
    Then a notification is dispatched
    And a reference to "My New Post" is persisted as the "object" of the notification
    And "delete" is persisted as the verb of the notification
    And a reference to "SiteOwner" is persisted as the "actor" of the notification
